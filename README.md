# PROJECT DEMO: LOCKCHAT - SIMPLIFIED

**THIS PROJECT WAS SIMPLIFIED SO YEAH THATS WHY ITS SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE AND ITS AN OPEN SOURCE.**

To make your own words and replies in go to *src/langs* and you'll see a bunch of languages but for now only 1 (English).
Now open it up with thonny IDE or any IDE you prefer such as notepad++ even more simpler, if its en.py is the basic one use this format:
*"<user's input>": "bot's reply"*

Or if enTest.py(Pre-beta) then use this format:
"*<user's input>*": [
        "*<bot's 1st reply message>*",
        "*<bot's 2nd reply message>*",
        "*<bot's 3rd reply message>*"
    ],
# Reminder: Each user-bot group is seperate by a **COMMA** so please remember even its in the en.py(beta).
