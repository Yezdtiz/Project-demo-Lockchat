# PROJECT DEMO: LOCKCHAT - SIMPLIFIED

**THIS PROJECT WAS SIMPLIFIED SO YEAH THATS WHY ITS SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE AND ITS AN OPEN SOURCE.**

To make your own words and replies in go to *src/langs* and you'll see a bunch of languages but for now only 1 (English).
Now open it up with thonny IDE or any IDE you prefer such as notepad++ even more simpler, if its en.py is the basic one use the format like the others and same for enTest.py.

# Reminder: Each user-bot group is seperate by a **COMMA** so please remember even its in the en.py(beta).



**By the way i will soon use Electron framework so be hyped but its a long time since i need to learn and uh irl stuffs, im not from anywhere in US/UK so dont ask why my english is so bad...**


# Requirements
*you need to run these commands for things to work:*
**For main.py:** `*pip install pygame*`
**For customTkinter.py**: `*pip install customTkinter*`

**PyQt6/PyQt5 is still working in progress so ignore it.**
